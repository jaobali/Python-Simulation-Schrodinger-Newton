# Schrodinger-Newton


In this project we developed an algorithim which can solve numerically the Schr√∂dinger-Newton equation during my physics master degree at the [Institute of Theoretical Physics](https://www.ift.unesp.br/). This equation was proposed to explain the emergency of the classical world from the quantum physics, feature that is not compleatly understanded yet and is one of the biggest problems to be solved in theoretical physics. With our results we could disfavor this equation as a prospect to solve this problem. For more details about the physics of the project and its results see our paper: [PHYSICAL REVIEW A](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.108.012214) or [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04914). The code (publiched at the repository) was whriten in Python and uses numerical liberies (numpy and scipy) and matplotlib to results visualizations. Furthermore, we have used the libery numba to increase its runing speed.
