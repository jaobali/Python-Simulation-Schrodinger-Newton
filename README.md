# Python Simulation: Schrodinger-Newton equation


<!--
In this project we developed an Pytohn algorithim (publiched at the repository) which can solve numerically the Schrödinger-Newton equation during my physics master degree at the [Institute of Theoretical Physics](https://www.ift.unesp.br/). This equation was proposed to explain the emergency of the classical world from the quantum physics, feature that is not compleatly understanded yet and is one of the biggest problems to be solved in theoretical physics. With our results we could disfavor this equation as a prospect to solve this problem. For more details about the physics of the project and its results see our paper: [PHYSICAL REVIEW A](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.108.012214) or [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04914). The code uses numerical liberies (numpy and scipy) and matplotlib to results visualizations. Furthermore, we have used the libery numba to increase its runing speed.

This project includes a Python algorithm developed during my physics master's degree at the [Institute of Theoretical Physics](https://www.ift.unesp.br/). The algorithm, which is publicly available in this repository solves the [Schrödinger-Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%E2%80%93Newton_equation) equation numerically.

The [Schrödinger-Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%E2%80%93Newton_equation) equation was proposed to explain the emergence of the classical world from quantum physics, a feature that is not completely understood yet and is one of the biggest problems in theoretical physics. Our results disfavor this equation as a prospect for solving this problem.

For more details about the physics of the project and its results, refer to our paper: [PHYSICAL REVIEW A](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.108.012214) or [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04914).

## Code Overview

The code uses numerical libraries, including NumPy and SciPy, and Matplotlib for result visualizations. Additionally, we have utilized the Numba library to enhance its running speed.
